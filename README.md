# Testimonials Grid

The aim of this project was to build this design set by [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7), with a heavy focus on practicing and testing my CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid skills. 

[Here is my version of the challenge](https://guydavidwhittaker.com/testimonials_grid/).
